# My portfolio website.
My very own website and it shows off my upcoming projects! (and my novice JavaScript skills!) 

This was one of my first steps taken to my begin some personal projects.

## Notes
We have migrated to react! It is quite finnicky and I dont think I know enough, so it will be a WIP.


# Uses
- MUI
- ReactJS
- React Sky (for the floating images)
- gh pages (for deployment)
